# Climate Impacts & Policy Drought Impact

The  purpose  of  this  assignment  is  that  students  learn  to  apply  the  methods  for  assessing  climate change  impacts  that  are  introduced  in  weeks  2  up  to  5,  and  learn  how  to  interpret  the  results  of these analyses. 


The assignments should be made individually.

# How to get the assignments up and running:

Go to: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/semvijverberg/ClimatePolicy/master)

Or download this repository and install a virtual environment. Recommended option is to use a [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
environment to work in for this project, relying on conda to handle some of the
trickier library dependencies:

```bash

# Add conda-forge channel for extra packages
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Create a conda environment for the project and install packages
conda env create -f environment.yml
activate ClimatePolicy

```
